In order to compile CUTE just type ./configure and make. After compiling cute 
is in the bin dir.
Before compiling make sure QTDIR contains the path to the QT installation 
( i.e. QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3 under SuSE ) and QMAKESPEC contains the dir path
to the qmake definitions (i.e. QMAKESPEC=/usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs/linux-g++/ under SuSE).
After compiling type ./install.

Please report any bug found in CUTE!
