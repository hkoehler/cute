INSTALL for CUTE

In order to compile CUTE yourself download the
QextScintilla source code ( http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk ).
In most cases the python libs and header files are already installed, 
if not download the python source code from www.python.org.

The PATH environment variable must include the QT bin dir, normally installed in /usr/lib/qt3/bin/, in order to find qmake.
Make sure QTDIR contains the path to the QT installation
( i.e. QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt3 under SuSE ) and QMAKESPEC contains the dir path
to the qmake definitions (for example: QMAKESPEC=/usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs/linux-g++/ under SuSE).
Compile the qscintilla libt.
Make sure qmake is in your PATH. It is installed in $QTDIR/bin 
where QTDIR is the install dir of QT.


QextScintilla:
		Go to the qt sub dir and type qmake qextscintilla.pro -o Makefile.
		Type make.
Python:
		Type ./configure. After configure type make and than make install as root.

Set QEXTSCINTILLADIR, PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and PYTHON_LIB_DIR
in cute.pro.
Type qmake cute.pro -o Makefile or simply ./configure.
Now CUTE should compile correctly.
Type install.
